"BUG DODGER"
==================================================================================================
Welcome to "BUG DODGER" my take on the Classic Arcade Game "Frogger"

The Game is not currently Udacious enough for my taste but here is how to play:

Open file in your browser: https://github.com/madtech2014/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/blob/master/index.html

Or download zip file to local pc and open index.html in browser after unzipping to computer: https://github.com/madtech2014/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/archive/master.zip

The player is reset to the starting location whenever:
	The game is started by launching the index.html file
	The player comes in contact with any of the Enemy Bugs
	The player makes it to the water without contacting a Enemy Bug
	
The movement of the player is:
	Up arrow - player moves up 1 square
	Down arrow - player moves down 1 square
	Left arrow - player moves 1 square to the left side of the game board
	Right arrow - player moves 1 square to the right side of the game board
	
The objective is to get the player to the water without coming in contact with the Enemy Bugs!
	You will Score 1 point every time the player makes the journey all the way to the water
	You will lose 1 point every time the player comes into contact with one of the Enemy Bugs!
Enjoy!
